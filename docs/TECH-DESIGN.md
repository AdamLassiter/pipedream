## **Technical Design Document (TDD)**

This is **not** part of a GDD.
It’s a separate engineering document:

* Architecture for card system
* Combat engine (turn order, damage pipeline, modifiers, RNG rules)
* Dialogue engine (branching, flags, persistent states across loops)
* Meta-progression system (Thread Slots, Influence, unlocks, roguelike resets)
* Save/load structure
* Procedural generation rules for nodes and maps
* Yggdrasil traversal logic
* Performance considerations
* AI behavior (including Gullveig’s 3 adaptive forms)

**Why you need it:**
Programmers cannot build from a narrative-driven GDD alone.
