## **UX / UI Flow Document**

Your GDD describes the narrative; you still need:

* Screens (Deck screen, Map, Combat UI, Dialogue UI, Wellspring UI, Artefact inventory)
* User flows for each:

  * Entering realm
  * Choosing a node
  * Winning/losing combat
  * Negotiation
  * Using Threads
  * Levelling classes
  * Prestige unlock process
* Accessibility rules
* Wireframes for each screen
