# **SECTION I — CORE GAME SYSTEMS**

This section defines the mechanical foundation of the entire game:
combat cards, negotiation cards, influence, resolve, progression, clans, prestige, and the Norn fate-system.


# **I.1 — Core Loop Overview**

## **Moment-to-Moment Gameplay**

Each turn (combat or negotiation) consists of:

1. **Draw Cards** (combat or negotiation deck based on context)
2. **Gain Resources** (Energy + Influence generation)
3. **Play Cards**
4. **End of Turn Effects Resolve**

Player chooses paths across Yggdrasil, encounters combat, negotiation scenes, quests, gods, Norns, and boss fights with Gullveig’s three forms.

## **The Dual Deck System**

Players maintain:

### **1. Combat Deck**

* Martial, Arcane, Divine, or Hybrid techniques
* Damage, defense, positioning, rune invocation
* Class-specific keywords (Berserk, Shieldwall, Runecharge, Omen, Devotion, etc.)

### **2. Negotiation Deck**

* Social/fate-based cards
* Influence creation, mental "attacks," Resolve defense
* Special Norn "Thread cards" enabling fate manipulation
* Clan-specific rhetorical styles

Combat = survival
Negotiation = narrative power, faction alignment, class unlocks, clan devotion, god interactions, Norn interactions.


# **I.2 — Resources**

## **Energy (Combat)**

* Base: 3 per turn
* Can increase to 4/5 through relics, class passives, or clan devotion.
* Some classes (Witch of the North, Master of the Futhark) generate **Rune Energy** (temporary, fading each turn).

## **Resolve (Negotiation Health)**

* Starts at 30–45 depending on class
* If Resolve reaches 0:

  * You automatically fail the negotiation
  * You may lose clan devotion, artifacts, or prestige progress
  * Certain gods may become hostile
  * Some bosses gain strength in future encounters (Skuld subtle meta)

## **Influence**

Influence is **the soul of the negotiation system**.

### **Influence Types**

1. **Wolf Influence** → fear, speed, survival
2. **Bear Influence** → authority, strength, unyielding presence
3. **Raven Influence** → prophecy, knowledge, strategy
4. **Deer Influence** → compassion, healing, ritual harmony
5. **Fate Influence** → rare, from Norn interactions
6. **Shadow Influence** → Hel and Gullveig aligned entities
7. **Divine Influence** → gained from interaction with surviving gods

Influence:

* Buffs dialogue card effects
* Unlocks special branches of negotiation
* Can be *spent* to guarantee outcomes
* Determines access to clan-specific quests


# **I.3 — Influence Mechanics**

## **Gain Influence**

Typical ways:

* Dialogue cards (e.g., *Invoke the Wolf*, *Prophetic Insight*)
* Completing quests for clans/gods
* Norn "Thread Cards"
* Defeating negotiation opponents without losing Resolve
* Prestige class passives

## **Spend Influence**

You can spend Influence to:

* Force unique negotiation lines
* Unlock class prestige
* Reshape the path through Yggdrasil
* Gain artefacts or blessings normally unobtainable
* Access "Skuld Branches" (meta-progression)

Influence resets each run except:

* Norn-granted permanent **Thread Slots**
* Player-unlocked **Clan Oaths**


# **I.4 — Keywords (Combat & Negotiation)**

## **Combat Keywords**

* **Berserk**: Gain attack if damaged this turn; lose defense next turn.
* **Shieldwall**: Maintain block between turns up to X value.
* **Runecharge**: Gain rune tokens; spells consume them.
* **Omen**: Certain moves apply future triggers (explode, weaken, trigger rune effects).
* **Devotion**: Divine cards scale with total Influence.
* **Wildshape**: Wolf/Bear clans modify martial attacks when transformed.
* **Blood-Price**: Pay HP instead of energy.

## **Negotiation Keywords**

* **Composure**: Defense to Resolve.
* **Assertion**: Offensive argument card; damages Resolve.
* **Threadweave**: Manipulates Fate Threads (Norn mechanic).
* **Conviction**: Buff that increases damage of Assertions.
* **Deflection**: Converts incoming argument damage into Influence.
* **Prophecy**: Reveals enemy intents or upcoming fate events.
* **Appeal**: Diplomacy card; increases Influence by persuasion.


# **I.5 — Norn Fate System**

The Norns are the meta-progression system.

## **Thread Slots (Permanent Meta-Prog)**

Awarded by:

* Reaching each Wellspring
* Surviving Gullveig forms
* Unlocking secret branches of Yggdrasil

Thread Slots allow:

* Starting each run with one extra Influence card
* Starting with 1 Fate Thread
* Unlocking meta-dialogue options
* Higher chance of rare cards appearing
* "Skuld Choices": player accesses hidden narrative paths

## **Fate Threads**

Cards representing strands of destiny:

### **3 Types**

* **Red (Urðr)** — Past
* **Silver (Verðandi)** — Present
* **Black/Gold (Skuld)** — Future

### **Use in Negotiation**

* Red Threads let you *rewrite past events* (re-roll choices).
* Silver Threads let you *force current outcomes*.
* Black Threads let you *unlock new endings/class unlock routes/secret realms*.

### **Use in Combat**

* Predict future enemy moves
* Delay boss phases
* Gain temporary invulnerability
* Bind enemies with "inevitable fate" (execute if HP below threshold)


# **I.6 — Clan Devotion**

## **Clans & Their Godly Origins**

* **Wolf Clan** → Sköll/Hati (moon & sun hunters)
* **Bear Clan** → Tyr + surviving spirits of berserker cults
* **Raven Clan** → Odin (through Muninn & memory)
* **Deer Clan** → Freyr/Freyja (Vanir fertility + renewal)

## **Clan Oaths**

Once per run, player can swear an oath:

* Grants 2–3 powerful cards
* Grants a unique Influence type
* Unlocks clan-specific quests
* Unlocks synergy perks for prestige classes

Breaking an oath (via certain choices):

* Permanently removes certain Influence routes
* Alters NPC reactions
* Strengthens Hel’s forces


# **I.7 — Classes & Prestige System Overview**

These will be expanded in **Section IV**, but here is the core integration.

### **Starting Classes**

(Each has 20–30 abilities)

**Martial**

* Berserker → Wolf-Shifter
* Shieldmaiden → Valkyrie

**Ranged**

* Hunter → Skald Warrior-Poet
* Marksman → Huntsman of Skadi

**Arcane**

* Seer → Witch of the North
* Rune Mage → Master of the Futhark

**Divine**

* Skald-Priest → Thor’s Chosen
* Seidr-Witch → Seeress of Freyja

Prestige unlock requires:

* A Midgard "Fate Trial" (secret Norn event)
* Possession of at least 10 Influence across clans
* A special negotiation victory

Prestige classes gain:

* New Fate cards
* 2–3 new ultimate abilities
* Access to "Second Form" wildshape (Wolf/Bear) or divine channels (Deer/Raven)


# **I.8 — Wellsprings & Checkpoints**

## **Three Wellsprings**

1. **Hvergelmir** — Act I → Niflheim → Muspelheim
2. **Mímisbrunnr** — Act II → Myrkheim/Jotunheim
3. **Urðarbrunnr** — Act III → Midgard → Alfheim/Svartalfheim → Asgard/Vanaheim

At each Wellspring:

* Gullveig ambushes → boss fight
* Wellspring unlocks Thread Slot
* Can exchange artefacts
* Can heal Resolve & HP
* Gain 1 free rare card per deck
* Unlock new path options


# **I.9 — Meta-Progression (Subtle Skuld Themes)**

The player (real human) is **Skuld**, the third Norn.

Meta-progression therefore expressed as:

* Unlocking new **Thread Slots**
* Unlocking new **argument branches**
* Unlocking new **rune synergies**
* Access to lore dialogue that implies only *Skuld* (the player) remembers previous cycles

The Norns NEVER directly state the player is Skuld, but:

* They never appear together
* Urðr references "the one who has not yet arrived" when addressing the PC
* Verðandi sometimes looks "behind" the player
* Gullveig in her final form explicitly recognizes the truth in late negotiation

# **REALM 1 — NIFLHEIM: THE FROSTBORN ROOTS OF YGGDRASIL**

### **Narrative Flavor Overview**

> Beneath the gnarled roots of Yggdrasil, the cold breath of Ginnungagap lingers. Frost-laden fog curls around skeletal trees, carrying whispers of lives long ended.

Here, the player awakens, a newborn embodiment of hope amidst the ashes, and begins the long ascent toward the Nine Worlds.

Muspelheim, the land of fire giants and volcanic storms, is a place where survival itself burns at every step.

Here, the remnants of lost magic fester, and creatures long thought dead whisper promises and threats. The player must navigate winding canyons, haunted ruins, and fog-choked forests where the very air seems sentient.

The player must contend with beings of immense strength, political intrigue among the surviving Jötnar, and the weight of natural catastrophes left behind by the cataclysm.

**Gullveig Dialogue (Form II — Envy)**

```
GULLVEIG:
"You dance among shadows and giants alike, yet you think your ascent safe?  
Envy is no petty thing—it grows, as do I. Will your threads suffice?"
PLAYER CHOICES:
1. Attack outright (combat)  
2. Negotiate using Threads  
3. Sacrifice Influence to preserve artefacts
```


# **ACT III — ASCENT TO VALHALLA**

### **Narrative Flavor Overview**

> As the player climbs toward the upper branches of Yggdrasil, the realms of the gods lie in ruin. Asgard is a shadow of its former glory, the halls of Valhalla flicker with dying light, and the Vanir remain scattered and wary. The threads of fate tighten, the Norns’ presence looms heavier, and Gullveig, now fully powered and transformed, stalks the player’s path with vengeance.
> Every decision, every use of Threads, every alliance or betrayal, will shape the final confrontation and the ultimate fate of the Nine Worlds.


# **REALM 7 — VANAHEIM: THE VANIR REFUGE**

### **Narrative Flavor**

> The Vanir, masters of magic and fertility, survived Ragnarök in scattered enclaves. Vanaheim is lush but scarred by conflict. Player quests revolve around diplomacy, rebuilding alliances, and collecting Vanir artefacts for the final confrontation.


### **Sample Vanaheim Quests (01–04)**

   * **Objective:** Aid surviving Vanir in restoring a sacred grove

# **REALM 8 — ASGARD: THE DYING HALLS**

### **Narrative Flavor**

> Asgard is largely destroyed. The gods who survived are weakened or fragmented. Thor is dead, Odin slain by Fenrir, and many halls lie in ruin. Player must navigate collapsed palaces, confront surviving gods or their spirits, and prepare for the final confrontation with Gullveig.


### **Sample Asgard Quests (01–04)**

# **REALM 9 — VALHALLA: THE ASCENDING END**

### **Narrative Flavor**

* **Phase 3:** Final adaptive attack; tests all meta-progression, Thread slots, and prestige class choices

**Dialogue**

```
GULLVEIG:
"Fools of the nine worlds, you think your ascent can undo what I have endured!  
I am more than greed... more than envy... I am vengeance incarnate!"
PLAYER CHOICES:
1. Attack (combat)  
2. Use Threads to counter or manipulate  
3. Negotiate with Influence to force temporary truce  
```



# **ENDING PATHS**

### **1. Redemption**

* Gullveig healed or transformed
* Nine realms begin a new cycle in balance
* Player may become mortal hero or minor deity
* Moral choices favor mercy, alliance, and restoration

### **2. Domination**

* Player binds Gullveig’s power at cost
* Ascends to godhood or semi-divine status
* Realms are reshaped under player’s will
* Moral choices favor power, conquest, and sacrifice

### **3. Escape**

* Player fails to stop Gullveig but survives
* Holds shard of hope, implying future cycles
* Realms remain in chaos
* Moral choices favor survival over heroism

### **4. Transcendence** *(New Ending Idea)*

* Player merges with Norns’ threads, becoming the **human embodiment of Skuld**
* Meta-loop revealed: only by transcending their role as mortal can the player break the cycle
* Realms are subtly reshaped; the player is neither fully mortal nor god, but eternal observer
* Moral choice: selflessness, meta-narrative awareness, "stop playing" implication
