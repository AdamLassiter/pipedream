## **Dialogue / Quest Scripting Format**

You now have summary descriptions + samples.
You still need actual script files in game-ready markup:

* Yarn Spinner format / Ink / custom markup
* Variables to track (Influence, Threads, past choices)
* Conditions for branching text
* Scripted QTE or difficulty-check dialogue lines
* Full scripts for Urðr, Verðandi, Gullveig (all forms), NPCs
