## **System Balancing Document**

A spreadsheet-heavy companion:

* HP ranges per realm
* Expected card damage scaling
* Deck size vs. power curves
* Enemy stat curves (per act, realm, and difficulty)
* Influence scaling for negotiation encounters
* Thread slot acquisition / cost curves
* Prestige class power curves
* Artefact rarity and distribution
* Gullveig battle tuning per loop/reset

**Why you need it:**
The game must feel fair, winnable, but challenging.
