## **Art Bible / Style Guide**

You have heavy lore and mood but need:

* Visual tone: color palettes, value ranges, lighting
* Character shape language
* Realm-specific aesthetic rules (Niflheim frost motifs vs. Muspelheim flame fractals vs. Alfheim light geometries)
* Card iconography guide
* UI layout frameworks
* Animation specs
* VFX style rules (Threads, fate manipulation, magic)

**Why you need it:**
Artists can’t start without constraints.
