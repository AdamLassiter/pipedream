## **Lore and Narrative Consistency Document**

Because Norse myth is complex, this doc tracks:

* Canon vs. creative reinterpretation
* Timeline of Ragnarök events
* Rules for fate, Thread use, and Norns
* Gullveig metaphysics
* NPC lore
* What’s historically accurate vs. your game’s “canon override”
